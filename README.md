# NbSimpleFSM-Godot

_Yet another simple FSM for Godot 4.x. This FSM is heavily inspired by [godot-statecharts](https://github.com/derkork/godot-statecharts). Our goal was to keep the workflow but streamline it to our use cases._

## Features
This FSM implementations offers advanced functionalities like parallelism, broadcasting and delays. Many error checks that can occur during the development process are deliberately omitted in order to be more performant.
